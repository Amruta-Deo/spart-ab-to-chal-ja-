        <h3>Don't Let The Fear Of Falling Keep You From Flying.... </h3>
        
        
        
        <p class="yes"> Just one <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_length">short-haul</a> flight a year produces around 10% of our individual carbon emissions.
            While the means of ground travel like the trains produce just half of the CO2 of a plane, but as we know it's preety time consuming. What if we could 
            travel with the speed of air travel but with the lower emissions of ground-travel? 
            <br><br>
            Here's the solution for this major dilemma...

            An airship or dirigible balloon is a type of aerostat or lighter-than-air aircraft that can navigate through the air under its own power.

        <p> Following are some of the advantages of the airships.

        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>Airships are very light and capable of being steered or directed,  changing direction quickly without changing speed,
                     or even remaining stationary.</li>
                <li>Their low fuel consumption makes them ideal for hovering stationary for a long duration of time over a specific area.</li>
                <li>Because of their large surface area and low speeds, turbulence is virtually non-existent. You are not likely to get airsick on an airship.</li>
                <li>Their cabins being depressurized allows you the opportunity to stick your head out and look down at the world.
                    This sounds fascinating, right?.

        <p class="correct"> Now it's time to learn more about these airships.
            There are three types of airship are non-rigid, semi-rigid, and rigid.
             Non-rigid airships(blimps), depend on internal pressure to maintain their shape. Semi-rigid airships maintain the envelope shape by
             internal pressure, but have some form of supporting structure, such as a fixed keel, attached to it. Rigid airships have an outer 
             structural framework that maintains the shape and carries all structural loads, while the lifting gas is contained in one or more 
             internal gasbags or cells. 
             Let's dive deep into the history of this airships.
             <br>
             <img src="download2.png">

             In 17th century, the Jesuit Father Francesco Lana de Terzi, the "Father of Aeronautics", published a description of an "Aerial Ship"
             which was supported by four copper spheres from which the air was evacuated. This sounds good, right?, but such a craft was 
             unrealizable then and remains so even today. Wondering why? As the external air pressure would cause the spheres to collapse unless their
             thickness was such as to make them too heavy to be buoyant. A hypothetical craft constructed using this principle is known as a vacuum airship.
