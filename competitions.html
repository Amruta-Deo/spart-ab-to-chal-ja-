        <h1>World Solar Airship Race</h1>
    <p>
        The World Solar Airship Race is a race for solar powered autonomous airships across the South Atlantic from South Africa 
        to Brazil. The racers are student teams from universities from around the world. The Fédération Aéronautique International
         / World Air Sports Federation will observe and record the results. The first race will take place in December 2023.
         <br>
         The World Solar Airship Race is made to stimulate research into, and development of, sustainable air transport and is primarily
          a design competition. The regulatory philosophy is to provide student teams with the parameters on which to base the design,
         rather than specify exactly how to build a solar airship. Science and technology evolve and to encourage the most innovative 
         ideas, event requirements also evolve. One important aspect of “sustainable” means the competing airships must use hydrogen
         as a lifting gas. Compared to helium, which today is seen as the only option for safety reasons, hydrogen is really the only
         long term sustainable solution for an industry of notable scale.
